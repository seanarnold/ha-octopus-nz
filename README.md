# Octopus Energy NZ for Home Assistant

Brings Octopus Energy **New Zealand** consumption, solar export, tariff bands
and costs into Home Assistant, including a full year of backfilled history for
the Energy dashboard.

> This is for Octopus Energy NZ. The widely used
> [BottlecapDave integration](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy)
> is built against Octopus UK and will not work with an NZ account — each
> Octopus country runs a separate Kraken tenant with a different schema.

## What you get

**Energy dashboard.** Long-term statistics, written against the time the
energy was actually used:

| Statistic | What |
|---|---|
| `octopus_nz:electricity_consumption` | kWh imported per hour |
| `octopus_nz:electricity_cost` | Cost per hour, priced per time-of-use band, plus the daily charge |
| `octopus_nz:electricity_export` | kWh exported per hour (solar accounts) |
| `octopus_nz:electricity_export_compensation` | What Octopus pays per hour for that export, priced per band (solar accounts) |

On first run these backfill up to 12 months, so the Energy dashboard has
history immediately rather than starting from empty.

The export pair only appears once Octopus has attached export rates to your
plan, which it does when the property is set up to export.

**Sensors.**

| Sensor | What |
|---|---|
| Current tariff band | `Peak` / `Off-peak` / `Night`, right now |
| Current unit rate | $/kWh you pay, right now |
| Current export rate | $/kWh Octopus pays you, right now (solar accounts) |
| Daily charge | The plan's fixed daily supply charge |
| Last full day consumption | kWh imported for the most recent complete day |
| Latest interval consumption | The most recent metered half hour of import |
| Last full day export | kWh exported for the most recent complete day (solar accounts) |
| Latest interval export | The most recent metered half hour of export (solar accounts) |
| Account balance | Your Octopus balance |

Export rates are time-of-use too — on OctopusFlexi the peak export rate is
higher than the off-peak one — so `Current export rate` is the sensor to
automate battery discharge on.

## When metered data arrives

Not live, and not a rolling delay either. Kraken publishes **one whole calendar
day at a time**, and the drop lands at about **21:00 NZ**, carrying the day that
ended at the previous midnight. Nothing appears in between.

So the newest half hour you hold sawtooths between about 21 and 45 hours old:

| You look (NZ) | Newest interval ends | Age |
|---|---|---|
| Fri 09:00 | Thu 00:00 | 33 h |
| Fri 20:59 | Thu 00:00 | 45 h |
| Fri 21:05 | Fri 00:00 | 21 h |

Practical consequence: **for yesterday's total, read after about 21:30.** Before
that you are still looking at the day before.

This is a property of New Zealand metering — the metering equipment provider
files each day's half hours to the retailer the following day — and not
something an integration can improve on. Every door in the Kraken NZ tenant
stops at the same midnight boundary; see the dead ends in `api.py`.

So:

- **Consumption and cost are history.** Excellent for the Energy dashboard and
  for understanding usage. Useless as an automation trigger.
- **The tariff sensors are live.** Bands are a property of the clock and are
  known in advance, so `Current tariff band` and `Current unit rate` are always
  correct right now. These are what you automate on.

Shift a load to the cheap band:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Heat water off-peak
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: sensor.octopus_nz_current_tariff_band
        to: "Night"
    actions:
      - action: water_heater.set_operation_mode
        target:
          entity_id: water_heater.hot_water
        data:
          operation_mode: performance
```

For live whole-house power you need local hardware — an optical pulse reader on
the meter's LED, or a Shelly EM with CT clamps.

## Install

### HACS

1. HACS → three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
2. Add `https://github.com/corrin/ha-octopus-nz`, category **Integration**
3. Install **Octopus Energy NZ**, then restart Home Assistant
4. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Octopus Energy NZ**

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/octopus_nz/` into your `config/custom_components/`
directory and restart.

## Configure

Sign in with the email and password you use for the Octopus Energy NZ app.

Then wire it into the Energy dashboard at **Settings → Dashboards → Energy**,
under **Electricity grid**:

- **No grid source yet:** *Add consumption*, pick
  `octopus_nz:electricity_consumption`, and under cost choose *Use an entity
  tracking the total costs* → `octopus_nz:electricity_cost`. With solar, *Add
  return* with `octopus_nz:electricity_export` and
  `octopus_nz:electricity_export_compensation` as its compensation.
- **Already have a grid source** (a Powerwall, a Shelly EM, an inverter):
  keep its kWh and just attach the Octopus money to it — edit the source,
  choose *Use an entity tracking the total costs* → `octopus_nz:electricity_cost`,
  and for return *Use an entity tracking the total compensation* →
  `octopus_nz:electricity_export_compensation`. Do not add the Octopus kWh as
  a second grid source; that double-counts.

Octopus prices the retailer's own meter data, which lands a day or two after
a local meter, so the dashboard's money trails its kWh by that much.

### Why the password is stored

Kraken issues a customer no durable credential. `viewer.liveSecretKey` is null
on the NZ tenant, `obtainLongLivedRefreshToken` is reserved for third-party
organisations, and refresh tokens expire after a week. An integration that kept
only a refresh token would break the first time Home Assistant was off for a
week. The password is held in the config entry, like every other
username/password integration in Home Assistant.

## Cost accuracy

Costs are computed from the plan's own rates and time-of-use windows, both read
from your account, priced per half-hour interval, with the fixed daily charge
added once per day.

Verified against the Octopus web dashboard across six days: consumption and the
Night / Off-peak / Peak split matched to three decimal places, with no
unclassified energy.

The figure is an estimate of usage charges. It will not match a bill to the
cent — bills also carry prompt-payment discounts, credits and adjustments this
integration does not see.

## Notes

- Export is read from the same meter data as consumption (`GENERATION`
  direction) and priced with the plan's export rates, which Kraken files as
  negative unit rates on the agreement.
- Multiple accounts on one login are supported; add the integration once per
  account.
- Diagnostics (Devices & Services → Octopus Energy NZ → Download diagnostics)
  dump the parsed tariff and windows, which is the fastest way to see what your
  plan actually looks like.

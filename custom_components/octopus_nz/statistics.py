"""Import metered consumption, export and their money as long-term statistics.

Readings arrive about two days late, so they can never be sensor states -- a
sensor records the moment it is written. Statistics are written against the
timestamp the energy was actually used, which is what the Energy dashboard
needs and what makes a year of history possible on first run.

Statistics are hourly, so half-hourly intervals are summed in pairs. New
Zealand's UTC offsets are whole hours, so a UTC hour boundary is also a local
one and no interval ever straddles two buckets.
